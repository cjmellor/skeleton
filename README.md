Otherwise, you can clone this repository into a new folder and launch the install:

cd my-package

composer install
```

If you cloned the repo, you will need to remove the `origin` remote and add a new one

```bash
git remote remove origin

git remote add origin git@github.com:<username>/<package-name>.git
```

Replace `<username` and `<package-name>` where applicable.

## Usage

Run the following command to generate a package skeleton:

```bash
php build
```

You will be prompted with multiple questions in relation to your package. Once you have answered all the questions, the package skeleton will be generated.
